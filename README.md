# Hello Idris2

This is a template of an idris2 project. It has some simple modules setup, golden tests created, and a github action to run them.

There's comments scattered throughout that'll hopefully help you customise this to your own needs.

This is still an early draft for this, so if you can think of any features that would be good to showcase, comments to add, package manages to configure, please do contribute them! And feel free to open issues if you run into any.
